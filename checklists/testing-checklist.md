# Testing Checklist

## Acceptance Test Checklist

### TA-01: Each Page has an isDisplayed() acceptance test.

We use [Playwrite](https://playwright.dev/) to test the user interface. For each page in the user interface, there should be an acceptance test that verifies that the page can be displayed successfully.

### TA-02: Each form has an acceptance test.

If a page has a form, there is an associated acceptance test to ensure that it behaves correctly.
